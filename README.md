# Inventory-check-for-Flags-Pending-Order
We would like to have a report created that includes: Shipment ID and SKUs associated with shipment as well as inventory locations and amounts for each SKU.This will help customer service team keep up with customer orders.This report also will be used by the flags pending team to investigate shipments with that worktype. The SKU information will give them insight as to whether the shipment is waiting for units, has an oversold SKU, needs to be split and sent (if so, to which facility), is a corporate or CS component replacement, or has a flagging issue.Also, I added the inventory in all warehouse column for team to check which warehouse have the stock to supply the back orders.
